# INVENTORY

# In this project I created a tool for a shoe company, which they can unitilise to keep a detailed record of their stock.

# To install and use simply download the inventory.py and the inventory.txt and run the program.

# The program it's self comes with a menu that makes it easy to use so the user can get as much information as efficently as possible.
